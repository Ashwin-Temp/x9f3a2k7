Calculate First Discount (5%):\n5% of 1200 = (5/100) x 1200 = ₹60.\nPrice after first discount = 1200 - 60 = ₹1,140.\n2. Calculate Second Discount (15%):\nCalculate 15% on the reduced price (₹1,140).\n15% of 1140 = (15/100) x 1140 = ₹171.\n3. Total Discount:\nTotal Discount = First Discount + Second Discount\nTotal = 60 + 171 = ₹231.\n--------------------------------------------------\nMethod 2: Effective Percentage Formula\nFormula for successive discounts of x% and y%:\nEffective % = x + y - (xy / 100)\n1. Substitute values (x = 5, y = 15):\nEffective % = 5 + 15 - (5 x 15 / 100)\n= 20 - (75 / 100)\n= 20 - 0.75 = 19.25%\n2.

Understand the Story:\nThe shopkeeper gives 4 items free when you buy 15.\nThis means he actually gives away 19 items in total (15 sold + 4 free).\nHe earns money only for the 15 items.\n2. Let's assume values:\nLet the Cost Price (CP) of 1 item = ₹100.\nTotal CP for 19 items = 19 x 100 = ₹1900.\n3. Calculate Selling Price (SP) from Profit:\nHe gains 35% profit on the *whole* deal.\nTotal SP = Total CP + 35% Profit\nTotal SP = 1900 + (35/100 x 1900)\nTotal SP = 1900 + 665 = ₹2565.\n4. Calculate Marked Price (MP) from Revenue:\nThis ₹2565 revenue comes from selling 15 items.\nBut wait! He gave a 10% discount on these 15 items.\nLet the Marked Price of 1 item = M.\nPrice of 15 items = 15M.\nAfter 10% discount, he sells them at 90% of their value.\nRevenue = 15M x 90% = 15M x 0.9 = 13.5M.\n5. Match the Revenue:\n13.5M = 2565\nM = 2565 / 13.5\nM = 190.\n6. Conclusion:\nCost Price (CP) = ₹100\nMarked Price (MP) = ₹190\nMarkup = 190 - 100 = ₹90.\nMarkup % = (90 / 100) x 100 = 90%.\n--------------------------------------------------\nMethod 2: The Ratio Formula\nFormula: MP/CP = (100 + Profit%) / (100 - Effective_Discount%)\n1. Calculate Effective Discount:\nDiscount 1 (Cash): 10%\nDiscount 2 (Free Items): Buy 15 Get 4 Free.\nFree Discount % = (Free / Total) x 100 = (4 / 19) x 100 = 21.05%\nUsing Successive Discount formula is hard here. Let's use the Ratio Equation method:\nSelling Price of 19 items cost = Selling Price of 15 items sold\nUse this shortcut relation:\nMP / CP = [ (100 + Profit%) x Total_Qty ] / [ (100 - Discount%) x Paid_Qty ]\nMP / CP = [ (100 + 35) x 19 ] / [ (100 - 10) x 15 ]\nMP / CP = [ 135 x 19 ] / [ 90 x 15 ]\nMP / CP = 2565 / 1350\nMP / CP = 1.9 / 1\nThis means MP is 1.9 times CP.\nSo MP is 90% more than CP."},{"id":9,"subject":"Reasoning","topic":"Classification","q":"Based on the English alphabetical order, three of the following four letter-clusters are alike in a certain way and thus form a group.
